After completing the review, read the review log and config to display the dashboard.

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/chief/bin/chief-review-read
\`\`\`

Parse the output. Find the most recent entry for each skill (plan-ceo-review, plan-eng-review, plan-design-review, design-review-lite, codex-review). Ignore entries with timestamps older than 7 days. For Design Review, show whichever is more recent between \`plan-design-review\` (full visual audit) and \`design-review-lite\` (code-level check). Append "(FULL)" or "(LITE)" to the status to distinguish. Display:

**Review tiers:**
- **Eng Review (required by default):** The only review that gates shipping. Covers architecture, code quality, tests, performance. Can be disabled globally with \\\`chief-config set skip_eng_review true\\\` (the "don't bother me" setting).
- **CEO Review (optional):** Use your judgment. Recommend it for big product/business changes, new user-facing features, or scope decisions. Skip for bug fixes, refactors, infra, and cleanup.
- **Design Review (optional):** Use your judgment. Recommend it for UI/UX changes. Skip for backend-only, infra, or prompt-only changes.
- **Codex Review (optional):** Independent second opinion from OpenAI Codex CLI. Shows pass/fail gate. Recommend for critical code changes where a second AI perspective adds value. Skip when Codex CLI is not installed.

**Verdict logic:**
- **CLEARED**: Eng Review has >= 1 entry within 7 days with status "clean" (or \\\`skip_eng_review\\\` is \\\`true\\\`)
- **NOT CLEARED**: Eng Review missing, stale (>7 days), or has open issues
- CEO, Design, and Codex reviews are shown for context but never block shipping
- If \\\`skip_eng_review\\\` config is \\\`true\\\`, Eng Review shows "SKIPPED (global)" and verdict is CLEARED

**Staleness detection:** After displaying the dashboard, check if any existing reviews may be stale:
- Parse the \\\`---HEAD---\\\` section from the bash output to get the current HEAD commit hash
- For each review entry that has a \\\`commit\\\` field: compare it against the current HEAD. If different, count elapsed commits: \\\`git rev-list --count STORED_COMMIT..HEAD\\\`. Display: "Note: {skill} review from {date} may be stale — {N} commits since review"
- For entries without a \\\`commit\\\` field (legacy entries): display "Note: {skill} review from {date} has no commit tracking — consider re-running for accurate staleness detection"
- If all reviews match the current HEAD, do not display any staleness notes`;
}
